Passing a single string as *labels* to `Sankey.add`
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Previously, `Sankey.add` would only accept a single string as the *labels*
argument if its length is equal to the number of flows, in which case it would
use one character of the string for each flow.

The behavior has been changed to match the documented one: when a single string
is passed, it is used to label all the flows.
