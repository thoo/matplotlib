Invalid inputs
``````````````

Passing invalid locations to `legend` and `table` used to fallback on a default
location.  This behavior is deprecated and will throw an exception in a future
version.

`offsetbox.AnchoredText` is unable to handle the ``horizontalalignment`` or
``verticalalignment`` kwargs, and used to ignore them with a warning.  This
behavior is deprecated and will throw an exception in a future version.

Passing steps less than 1 or greater than 10 to `MaxNLocator` used to result in
undefined behavior.  It now throws a ValueError.
