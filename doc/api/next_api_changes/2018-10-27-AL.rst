``Axes.fmt_xdata`` and ``Axes.fmt_ydata`` no longer ignore TypeErrors raised by a user-provided formatter

Previously, if the user provided a ``fmt_xdata`` or ``fmt_ydata`` function that
raised a TypeError (or set them to a non-callable), the exception would be
silently ignored and the default formatter be used instead.  This is no longer
the case; the exception is now propagated out.
